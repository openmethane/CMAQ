********************************************************************************
Announcing the release of MCIP Version 4.2 (23 August 2013)
********************************************************************************

The MCIP code is updated to version 4.2.  These release notes and the change
log reflect all changes that have been made to MCIP since MCIPv4.1 (the last
official release).  Changes to MCIPv4.2 were made by Tanya Otte (U.S. EPA).
User contributions are also noted below.  The detailed list of changes to the
MCIP code is in the CHANGES file, which is part of the MCIP tar file in the
"doc" sub-directory.

MCIPv4.2 requires I/O API version 3.1 to support error-checking within the
I/O API.  This is consistent with the requirement for I/O API v3.1 with
CMAQv5.0.2 (released concurrently with MCIPv4.2).

MCIPv4.2 requires the netCDF F90 module (rather than the F77 include).

Users are encouraged to read the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) file,
which is located in the MCIP tar file in the "doc" sub-directory.

***Users should consult the FAQ before submitting inquiries to M3User,
   CMAS, or the code developers.***


Interactions with the following users (in alphabetical order) have resulted
in some of the code changes/corrections that were made for MCIPv4.2:

	Chris Misenis, U.S. EPA, Research Triangle Park, NC
        Jon Pleim, U.S. EPA, Research Triangle Park, NC
	Brian Timin, U.S. EPA, Research Triangle Park, NC


The following is a summary of the changes in MCIPv4.2:

 1.  Increased maximum number of input files for MCIP in order to handle one
     year of daily output files at a time.

 2.  Added option to process convective and non-convective precipitation if it
     is already incremental from WRF.

 3.  Added handling for 40-category 2006 NLCD-MODIS land use classification as
     "NLCD40".  Added alternate name for 50-category 2001 NLCD-MODIS land use
     classification as "NLCD50".

 4.  Read land-water mask from WRF and use directly for WRF runs that used the
     Pleim-Xiu land-surface model (rather than reconstructing inside MCIP).
     For other LSMs in WRF, the land-water mask is dynamic and ice points toggle
     from water to land.

 5.  Updated metadata for new physics options in WRFv3.4.1 and WRFv3.5.
